Hello!!!

If you don't know me, I'm Adam (idk why you're here but) welcome to my "blog" ??? idk what to call this place. I'll be writing about everything I learn/read as time goes by, you can think of this place as an archive of whatever I have learn.

This began as a project where I wanted to build a website that would record everything I write and allow me to later in the future (thus the name) review the topics I've researched and read about.

Again, if you love reading and have time to spare, this is the right place for you.

Hope you learn something new here, if you want to suggest any changes or just give your thoughts on the website or a post do reach out to me on any of my socials.
