Hello!!!

If you don't know me, I'm Adam (idk why you're here but) welcome to my "blog" ??? idk what to call this place, but ill be writing about everything I learn/read as time goes by, you can think of this place as an archive of whatever I have learned.

This started as a project where I wanted to create a website so that I could keep track of whatever I write and be able to look back at what areas Iâ€™ve explored and read about in the future (thus the name).

Again, if you love to read and have time to spare, this is the right place for you.

Hope you learn something new here, if you want to suggest any changes or just give your thoughts on the website or a post do reach out to me on any of my socials.
