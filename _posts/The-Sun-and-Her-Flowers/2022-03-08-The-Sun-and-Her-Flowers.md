## Summary + Notes

### Wilting

> it isnâ€™t what we left behind 
that breaks me 
itâ€™s what we couldâ€™ve built
had we stayed

> i knew i was beating a dead thing
but did it matter 
if the thing was dead
when at the very least 
i had it
> \- addiction

> day by day i realize
everything i miss about you 
was never there in the first place
> \- the person i fell in love with was a mirage

> you ask 
if we can still be friends
i explain how a honeybee 
does not dream of kissing
the mouth of a flower
and then settle for its leaves 
> \- i donâ€™t need more friends

### Falling

> i hear a thousand kind words about me 
and it makes no difference 
yet i hear one insult 
and all confidence shatters 
> \- focusing on the negative

> it felt like you threw me
so far from myself
iâ€™ve been trying to find my way back ever since

> this place makes me
the kind of exhausted that has
nothing to do with sleep
and everything to do with
the people around me 
> \- Introvert

> you do not just wake up and become the butterfly
> \- Growth is a process

> how can i verbalize consent as an adult if i was 
never taught to as a child

> despite knowing 
they wonâ€™t be here for long 
they still choose to live 
their brightest lives 
> \- sunflowers

> if weâ€™re present to take part in your happiness 
when your circumstances are great 
we are more than capable 
of sharing your pain

> i do not weep
because iâ€™m unhappy
i weep because i have everything 
yet i am unhappy

> nothing
in this world 
was promised or 
belonged to you anyway

> yes 
it is possible 
to hate and love someone
at the same time 
i do it to myself 
every day

> the way you speak of yourself
the way you degrade yourself
into smallness
is abuse

> what is stronger 
than the human heart
which shatters over and over
and still lives

> you have so much
but are always hungry for more 
stop looking up at everything you donâ€™t have
and look around at everything you do 
> \- where the satisfaction lives

### Rooting

> in the world so infinite
they could never use a full stop

### Blooming

> to hate
is an easy lazy thing
but to love
takes strength
everyone has
but not all are
willing to practice

> even if theyâ€™ve been separated
theyâ€™ll end up together 
you canâ€™t keep lovers apart 
no matter how much 
i pluck and pull them 
my eyebrows always 
find their way
back to each other

> it is a trillion-dollar industry that would collapse 
if we believed we were beautiful enough already
