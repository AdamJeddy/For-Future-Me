## Summary + Notes
---
### Paris
- To know someoneâ€™s dislikes was to be close to them.

### Mani Pedi
Context: This story was about an ex-boxer working in his sisters salon

- "Talk to me like Iâ€™m a client. Go on. Ask about my day, the weather, say something nice about me, try to make conversation." Raymond tried to think of what he could say, but before he could open his mouth his sister reassured him, "Donâ€™t you worry too much about this part. Most of the time they wonâ€™t talk to you because they think you donâ€™t know how to speak English, which is fine because itâ€™s exhausting to make conversation. I donâ€™t care about their kids or husbands or boyfriends or what the fuck theyâ€™re doing this weekend. If you donâ€™t want to talk to a client because youâ€™re tired or not interested, just turn to me and speak Lao. Theyâ€™ll think weâ€™re talking about them and thatâ€™ll shut them right the fuck up."

- Iâ€™m lucky if I get two or three dollars. Itâ€™s because youâ€™re a fucking man, isnâ€™t it? Even in a business I own myself and built up myself, men are still being paid more. And these are women who are doing this. They should know better!" And sheâ€™d look on angrily while he counted his tips, which often added up to more than what his sister charged for mani-pedis.

- One day his sister said, "What, you think you got a chance with that Miss Emily there? Sheâ€™s rich and educated. None of the things we are or are ever gonna be. Donâ€™t you be dreaming big now, little brother. Keep your dreams small. The size of a grain of rice. And cook that shit up and swallow it every night, then shit that fucking thing out in the morning. It ainâ€™t ever gonna happen. If thereâ€™s something I know in this life, itâ€™s rich women. And that woman ainâ€™t for you."

### Chick-A-Chee!
- The lunch woman on duty leaned through the crowd around us and said, "Donâ€™t you mean you went trick-or-treating?" We shook our heads. The woman did not know what she was talking about. I looked up at her big, round, intrusive face and said, "No, Missus Furman. We went Chick-A-Chee!"
