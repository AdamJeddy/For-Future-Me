## About the book
## What I Liked About It and What I didn't
- What I liked about the book
	- Takes a different approach to the idea of Time Travel
	- It is fiction but teaches a good life lesson
	- The writing is simple and clear
- What I didn't like about the book
	- Has a pessimistic theme (but I don't mind it that much xD)
	- Might be a bit slow paced
	- The whole story takes place in 1 setting; the cafe
	- The point it tries to make might be better as a show than a book

## Who Should Read It?
- People who wish that they can go back in time and change things

## My Top Quotes
> At the end of the day, whether one returns to the past or travels to the future, the present doesn't change.

> Treat them mean, keep them keen
