### Impression

What I liked
: Story telling done right, well written 
: The main plot wasn't predictable

What I didn't like
: Since parts of it was inspired by her mother's story I cant really tell if at certain parts it was poor writing or if it was meant to be like that. E.g. Lily saying someone is good because they donate to charity??
: In the end majority of the issues that came up were completely her fault such as hiding important information/details from her own husband even though she knows it would cause issues if he gets to know about it from someone other than herself.

### How I Discovered It
TikTok? idk but the book is pretty popular so I've seen it in different places

### Who Should Read It?
Young adults who want to learn about a different side of relationships

### Actionable Takeaways
- Not everyone is as they seem
- Abusive people will always stay abusive?

## Book Snippets
___
### Chapter One
- Dead fathers and exasperating roommates and questionable eulogies don’t feel so awful when the night sky is clear enough to literally feel the grandeur of the universe.

- If only my issues were as trivial as matters of the heart.

- He flicks it over the ledge. 
> “I feel like everyone fakes who they really are, when deep down we’re all equal amounts of screwed up. Some of us are just better at hiding it than others.”

- My favorite conversations are the ones with no real answers. “I don’t think being a little guarded is a negative thing,” I say. “Naked truths aren’t always pretty.”

### Chapter Three
Cleaning, decorating, picking out paint colors. I’m a Pinterest whore.”

### Chapter Fourteen
All humans make mistakes. What determines a person’s character aren’t the mistakes we make. It’s how we take those mistakes and turn them into lessons rather than excuses.

### Chapter Seventeen
I think about how sometimes, no matter how convinced you are that your life will turn out a certain way, all that certainty can be washed away with a simple change in tide.
