## About the book
## What I Liked About It and What I didn't
- What I liked
	- Very unique and niche theme of the book
	- Looks at a lot of sensitive topics in an unfiltered way but does a good job at it
	- Each chapter/story keep you guessing what its about
- What I didn't like
	- Due to the nature of the book it does get weird at times

## How I Discovered It

## Who Should Read It?

- Interested in immigrants and their stories 

## Summary + Notes
