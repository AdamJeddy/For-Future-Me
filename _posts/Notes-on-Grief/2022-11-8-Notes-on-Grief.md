### Top Quotes
> No one was prepared for how deeply besotted with sudoku my father became after he retired, much to my motherâ€™s irritation. â€˜He wonâ€™t eat,â€™ she would say, â€˜because heâ€™s busy playing sudoku.â€™ â€˜You donâ€™t play sudoku,â€™ he would reply mildly. â€˜Itâ€™s not Ludo.â€™

> I am writing about my father in the past tense, and I cannot believe I am writing about my father in the past tense.

## Summary + Notes
---
### Chapter 3.
You learn how much grief is about language, the failure of language and the grasping for language.

### Chapter 4.
â€˜You actually drink warm water, Daddy?â€™ I asked one day, surprised, laughing at him, after he said, with sheepish humour, that heâ€™d read somewhere that drinking warm water might prevent coronavirus. He laughed at himself and told me warm water was harmless, after all. It was not like the nonsense that went around during the Ebola scare, when people were bathing in saline before dawn.

### Chapter 10.
Ndo, in Igbo, comforts more, a word that is â€˜sorryâ€™ with a metaphysical heft, a word with borders wider than mere â€˜sorryâ€™.

### Chapter 15.
No one was prepared for how deeply besotted with sudoku my father became after he retired, much to my motherâ€™s irritation. â€˜He wonâ€™t eat,â€™ she would say, â€˜because heâ€™s busy playing sudoku.â€™ â€˜You donâ€™t play sudoku,â€™ he would reply mildly. â€˜Itâ€™s not Ludo.â€™

### Chapter 17.
Part of griefâ€™s tyranny is that it robs you of remembering the things that matter. His pride in me mattered, more than anyone elseâ€™s. He read everything I wrote, and his comments ranged from â€˜this isnâ€™t coherent at allâ€™ to â€˜you have outdone yourselfâ€™.

### Chapter 18.
To sit with him and talk about the past was like reclaiming gorgeous treasure that was always mine anyway. He gave me my ancestry in finely sketched stories. I not only adored him in that classic manner of a daddyâ€™s girl, but I also liked him so much. I like him. His grace and his wisdom and his simplicity, and how utterly unimpressionable he was. I liked his luminous, moderate faith, strong but worn lightly.

### Chapter 21.
A friend sends me a line from my novel: â€˜Grief was the celebration of love, those who could feel real grief were lucky to have loved.â€™ How odd to find it so exquisitely painful to read my own words.

### Chapter 30.
I am writing about my father in the past tense, and I cannot believe I am writing about my father in the past tense.
