## Summary + Notes
---
### CHAPTER ONE
> For you a thousand times over
\- Hassan

This line captures the essence of unconditional loyalty and sacrifice. Spoken by Hassan to Amir, it occurs during a pivotal scene where Hassan commits to running and fetching a kite for Amir, signifying his unwavering dedication and friendship. 

For Amir, this line becomes a haunting reminder of his own failings and the loyalty he could not reciprocate later on in the story.

This is not just a simple line about friendship; it is a pledge of unwavering loyalty and sacrifice. It beautifully captures the essence of Hassan's character and sets the tone for the moral and emotional landscape of `The Kite Runner.` 



### CHAPTER THREE
- "When you kill a man, you steal a life," Baba said. "You steal his wife’s right to a husband, rob his children of a father. When you tell a lie, you steal someone’s right to the truth. When you cheat, you steal the right to fairness. Do you see?"

- "And where is he headed?" Baba said. "A boy who won’t stand up for himself becomes a man who can’t stand up to anything."


### CHAPTER FOUR
- Never mind any of those things. Because history isn’t easy to overcome. Neither is religion. In the end, I was a Pashtun and he was a Hazara, I was Sunni and he was Shi’a, and nothing was ever going to change that. Nothing.

- It appeared that on the same night I had learned about one of writing’s objectives, irony, I would also be introduced to one of its pitfalls: the Plot Hole. Taught by Hassan, of all people. Hassan who couldn’t read and had never written a single word in his entire life. A voice, cold and dark, suddenly whispered in my ear, What does he know, that illiterate Hazara? He’ll never be anything but a cook. How dare he criticize you?


### CHAPTER SIX
- The real fun began when a kite was cut. That was where the kite runners came in, those kids who chased the windblown kite drifting through the neighborhoods until it came spiraling down in a field, dropping in someone’s yard, on a tree, or a rooftop.

- And when a kite runner had his hands on a kite, no one could take it from him. That wasn’t a rule. That was custom.

- For kite runners, the most coveted prize was the last fallen kite of a winter tournament.

- But I remembered something my teacher had said that summer about Iranians, that they were grinning smooth talkers who patted you on the back with one hand and picked your pocket with the other. I told Baba about that and he said my teacher was one of those jealous Afghans, jealous because Iran was a rising power in Asia and most people around the world couldn’t even find Afghanistan on a world map. "It hurts to say that," he said, shrugging. ***"But better to get hurt by the truth than comforted with a lie."***


### CHAPTER TEN
- That first night, all the men prayed together. One of the refugees asked Baba why he wasn’t joining them. "God is going to save us all. Why don’t you pray to him?" Baba snorted a pinch of his snuff. Stretched his legs. "What’ll save us is eight cylinders and a good carburetor."


### CHAPTER ELEVEN
- "There are only three real men in this world, Amir," he’d say. He’d count them off on his fingers: America the brash savior, Britain, and Israel. "The rest of them—" he used to wave his hand and make a phht sound "—they’re like gossiping old women."

- In Baba’s view, Israel was an island of "real men" in a sea of Arabs too busy getting fat off their oil to care for their own. "Israel does this, Israel does that," Baba would say in a mock-Arabic accent. "Then do something about it! Take action. You’re Arabs, help the Palestinians, then!"

- I tried to get Baba to enroll in ESL classes to improve his broken English. But he scoffed at the idea. "Maybe I’ll spell ‘cat’ and the teacher will give me a glittery little star so I can run home and show it off to you," he’d grumble.

- Baba was like the widower who remarries but can’t let go of his dead wife. He missed the sugarcane fields of Jalalabad and the gardens of Paghman.

- For me, America was a place to bury my memories. For Baba, a place to mourn his.

- We got out and sat inside the Ford. It was a Grand Torino. Navy blue, Baba said.

> "Zendagi migzara," he said. Life goes on.


### CHAPTER TWELVE
- I remembered something Baba had said about Pashtuns once. We may be hardheaded and I know we’re far too proud, but, in the hour of need, believe me that there’s no one you’d rather have at your side than a Pashtun.


### CHAPTER FIFTEEN
- A CREATIVE WRITING TEACHER at San Jose State used to say about clichés: "Avoid them like the plague." Then he’d laugh at his own joke.

- We’re a melancholic people, we Afghans, aren’t we? Often, we wallow too much in ghamkhori and self-pity. We give in to loss, to suffering, accept it as a fact of life, even see it as necessary. Zendagi migzara, we say, life goes on.


### CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
- "What I’m asking from you is to grant an old man his dying wish," he said gravely. He had gambled with that comment. Played his best card. Or so I thought then. His words hung in limbo between us, but at least he’d known what to say. ***I was still searching for the right words, and I was the writer in the room.***


### CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
- Here is another cliché my creative writing teacher would have scoffed at; like father, like son. But it was true, wasn’t it? As it turned out, Baba and I were more alike than I’d ever known. We had both betrayed the people who would have given their lives for us. And with that came this realization: that Rahim Khan had summoned me here to atone not just for my sins but for Baba’s too.

### CHAPTER TWENTY
- ‘How seamless seemed love and then came trouble!’" A smile sprouted on my face. "I know that ghazal. That’s Hafez."

- Baba used to say, "Take two Afghans who’ve never met, put them in a room for ten minutes, and they’ll figure out how they’re related."

### CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
- I thought of a line I’d read somewhere, or maybe I’d heard someone say it: There are a lot of children in Afghanistan, but little childhood.


### CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
- I looked at the photo. Your father was a man torn between two halves, Rahim Khan had said in his letter. I had been the entitled half, the society-approved, legitimate half, the unwitting embodiment of Baba’s guilt.
