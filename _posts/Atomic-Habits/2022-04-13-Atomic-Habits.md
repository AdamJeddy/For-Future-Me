## Summary + Notes
---
### Introduction: My Story
Changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years
> “stimulus, response, reward” 
\- by B. F. Skinner in the 1930s 

Has been popularized more recently as 
> “cue, routine, reward” 
\- The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg.

### 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits
- Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. 
	- Same way that money multiplies through compound interest,  effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them.
- It is only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent.
- When we repeat 1% errors, day after day, by replicating poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little excuses, our small choices compound into toxic results.
- Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits.
- If you want to predict where you’ll end up in life, all you have to do is follow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses, and see how your daily choices will compound ten or twenty years down the line.
- Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.
- If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.
- Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress. A handful of problems arise when you spend too much time thinking about your goals and not enough time designing your systems.
- Winners and losers have the same goals.
- You treated a symptom without addressing the cause.
- The problem with a goals-first mentality is that you’re continually putting happiness off until the next milestone.

### 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)
- Process of building habits is actually the process of becoming yourself.

### 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Step
- Whenever you face a problem repeatedly, your brain begins to automate the process of solving it. Your habits are just a series of automatic solutions that solve the problems and stresses you face regularly.
- Behavioral scientist Jason Hreha writes
 > “Habits are, simply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment.”
- You think that you have to choose between building habits and attaining freedom. In reality, the two complement each other.
- Habits do not restrict freedom. They create it. In fact, the people who don’t have their habits handled are often the ones with the least amount of freedom.
- Cues are meaningless until they are interpreted. The thoughts, feelings, and emotions of the observer are what transform a cue into a craving.

### 4: The Man Who Didn’t Look Right
- There are no good habits or bad habits. There are only effective habits. That is, effective at solving problems.
- Pointing-and-Calling raises your level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your actions.

### 5: The Best Way to Start a New Habit
- Many people think they lack motivation when what they really lack is clarity.
- The Diderot Effect[^1] states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases.
- Habit stacking is a special form of an implementation intention. Rather than pairing your new habit with a particular time and location, you pair it with a current habit.
- Unlike an implementation intention, which specifically states the time and location for a given behavior, habit stacking implicitly has the time and location built into it.

### 6: Motivation Is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More
- Customers will occasionally buy products not because they want them but because of how they are presented to them.
- You don’t have to be the victim of your environment. You can also be the architect of it.
- Be the designer of your world and not merely the consumer of it.
- A stable environment where everything has a place and a purpose is an environment where habits can easily form.

### 7: The Secret to Self-Control
- The idea that a little bit of discipline would solve all our problems is deeply embedded in our culture. Recent research, however, shows something different.

> Here’s the punch line: You can break a habit, but you’re unlikely to forget it.
{: .prompt-info }

- It’s easier to avoid temptation than resist it.

### 8: How to Make a Habit Irresistible
> Dopamine is released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it.
{: .prompt-tip }

- Whenever you predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, your levels of dopamine spike in anticipation.
- Researchers have found that 100 percent of the nucleus accumbens is activated during wanting. Meanwhile, only 10 percent of the structure is activated during liking.
- Desire is the engine that drives behavior. Every action is taken because of the anticipation that precedes it. It is the craving that leads to the response.

### 9: The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits
- We soak up the qualities and practices of those around us.
- Most days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves.
- When changing your habits means challenging the tribe, change is unattractive.
- Once we fit in, we start looking for ways to stand out.

> The culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to us.
{: .prompt-danger }

- We tend to imitate the habits of 3 social groups: 
	1. The close (family and friends)
	2. The many (the tribe)
	3. The powerful (those with status and prestige).

### 10: How to Find and Fix the Causes of Your Bad Habits
- Your current habits are not necessarily the best way to solve the problems you face; `they are just the methods you learned to use`. Once you associate a solution with the problem you need to solve, you keep coming back to it.
- Now, imagine changing just one word: You don’t “have” to. You “get” to.

### 11: Walk Slowly, but Never Backward
- “The best is the enemy of the good.”
- Motion makes you feel like you’re getting things done. But really, you’re just preparing to get something done. `When preparation becomes a form of procrastination, you need to change something`.
- Both common sense and scientific evidence agree: 
    > repetition is a form of change
    {: .prompt-tip}

> habits form based on frequency, not time
{: .prompt-info }

### 12: The Law of Least Effort
- Human behavior follows the Law of Least Effort. We will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work.
- Reduce the friction associated with good behaviors. 
	- When friction is low, habits are easy.
- Increase the friction associated with bad behaviors. 
	- When friction is high, habits are difficult.

### 13: How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule
- The difference between a good day and a bad day is often a few productive and healthy choices made at decisive moments.
- Standardize before you optimize. You can’t improve a habit that doesn’t exist.

### 14: How to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible
- Sometimes success is less about making good habits easy and more about making bad habits hard.
- make your bad habits more difficult by creating what psychologists call a `commitment device`. 
	- A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that controls your actions in the future. It is a way to lock in future behavior, bind you to good habits, and restrict you from bad ones.

### 15: The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change
- Pleasure teaches your brain that a behavior is worth remembering and repeating.
- What is rewarded is repeated. What is punished is avoided.
	- What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided.
- Positive emotions cultivate habits. Negative emotions destroy them.
- We are not looking for just any type of satisfaction. We are looking for immediate satisfaction.
- The way your brain evaluates rewards is inconsistent across time.
- With our bad habits, the immediate outcome usually feels good, but the ultimate outcome feels bad. With good habits, it is the reverse: the immediate outcome is unenjoyable, but the ultimate outcome feels good.
- The human brain evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards.

### 16: How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day
- I try to remind myself of a simple rule: never miss twice.
- The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit.
- The problem is not slipping up; the problem is thinking that if you can’t do something perfectly, then you shouldn’t do it at all.
- `“The first rule of compounding: Never interrupt it unnecessarily.”`
- `We optimize for what we measure. When we choose the wrong measurement, we get the wrong behavior.`
- `Just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing.`

### 17: How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything
- Students show up to class when their grade is linked to attendance.
- We’ll jump through a lot of hoops to avoid a little bit of immediate pain.
- To be productive, the cost of procrastination must be greater than the cost of action.
	- `Cost of procrastinaton > Cost of Action`
- To make bad habits unsatisfying, your best option is to make them painful in the moment.

### 18: The Truth About Talent (When Genes Matter and When They Don’t)
- The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right field of competition. This is just as true with habit change as it is with sports and business.
- `If you are currently winning, you exploit, exploit, exploit. If you are currently losing, you continue to explore, explore, explore`.
- A good player works hard to win the game everyone else is playing. A great player creates a new game that favors their strengths and avoids their weaknesses.
- `Our genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on`.

### 19: The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work
- The Goldilocks Rule states that 
> "humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities"
- `Really successful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is that they still find a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom`.
- `The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom`
- At some point, everyone faces the same challenge on the journey of self-improvement: you have to fall in love with boredom
- Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way. Professionals know what is important to them and work toward it with purpose; amateurs get pulled off course by the urgencies of life.

### 20: The Downside of Creating Good Habits
> A lack of self-awareness is poison. Reflection and review is the antidote.
{: .prompt-danger }

### Conclusion: The Secret to Results That Last
> Small habits don’t add up. They compound. That’s the power of atomic habits. Tiny changes. Remarkable results.
{: .prompt-tip }

### Little Lessons from the Four Laws
- Awareness comes before desire.
- Happiness is simply the absence of desire.
>“Happiness is the space between one desire being fulfilled and a new desire forming.” Likewise, suffering is the space between craving a change in state and getting it.
> \- Caed Budris
- It is the idea of pleasure that we chase. 
> “He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.”
> \- Friedrich Nietzsche, the German philosopher and poe

> Being curious is better than being smart.
{: .prompt-tip }

- Craving comes before response. The feeling comes first, and then the behavior.
- We can only be rational and logical after we have been emotional.
- The primary mode of the brain is to feel; the secondary mode is to think.
- Your actions reveal how badly you want something. If you keep saying something is a priority but you never act on it, then you don’t really want it. It’s time to have an honest conversation with yourself. Your actions reveal your true motivations.
- Reward is on the other side of sacrifice. Response (sacrifice of energy) always precedes reward (the collection of resources). 
	- The “runner’s high” only comes after the hard run. The reward only comes after the energy is spent.
- Self-control is difficult because it is not satisfying.
- If you expect to get $10 and get $100, you feel great. If you expect to get $100 and get $10, you feel disappointed. 
    > Your expectation changes your satisfaction.
    {: .prompt-danger }

- When liking and wanting are approximately the same, you feel satisfied. 
    > Satisfaction = Liking – Wanting
    {: .prompt-info }

- `The pain of failure correlates to the height of expectation.` When desire is high, it hurts to not like the outcome. Failing to attain something you want hurts more than failing to attain something you didn’t think much about in the first place. 
	- This is why people say, “I don’t want to get my hopes up.”
- Hope declines with experience and is replaced by acceptance
- Aristotle noted, 
> “Youth is easily deceived because it is quick to hope.” Perhaps this can be revised to “Youth is easily deceived because it only hopes.”
