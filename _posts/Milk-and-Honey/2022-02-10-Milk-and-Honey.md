### My Top Quotes
- The hurting

> she was a rose
in the hands of those
who had no intention
of keeping her

> trying to convince myself
i am allowed
to take up space
is like writing with
my left hand
when i was born
to use my right

> i canâ€™t tell if my mother is
terrified or in love with
my father it all
looks the same

- The loving

> i struggle so deeply
to understand
how someone can
pour their entire soul
blood and energy
into someone
without wanting
anything in
return

> you are the faint line
between faith and
blindly waiting

> iâ€™d be lying if i said
you make me speechless
the truth is you make my
tongue so weak it forgets
what language to speak in

- The breaking

> it means nothing to me if he loves you
if he canâ€™t do a single wretched thing about it

> i left because the longer
i stayed the less
i loved myself

I can see a cringe post with this quote
> i am a museum full of art
but you had your eyes shut

> you treat them like they
have a heart like yours
but not everyone can be as
soft and as tender
> 
> you donâ€™t see the
person they are
you see the person
they have the potential to be
> 
> you give and give till
they pull everything out of you
and leave you empty

> i donâ€™t know why
i split myself open
for others knowing
sewing myself up
hurts this much
afterward

> i am losing parts of you like i lose eyelashes
unknowingly and everywhere

- The healing

> do not bother holding on to
that thing that does not want you

> it is a part of the
human experience to feel pain
do not be afraid
open yourself to it

> how you love yourself is
how you teach others
to love you
