Albert Camus puts together philosophy, literature, and mythology to explore the depths of existential inquiry and the concept of the absurd. Camus challenges readers to confront the fundamental question of whether life is worth living without a predetermined meaning. 

Through the essay and a series of poignant reflections, Camus argues against suicide as a solution to the absurdity of life, advocating instead for a life lived with full awareness of its inherent contradictions. This collection, discovered after an encounter with Camus's "The Stranger," offers a profound examination of human existence, encouraging a thoughtful exploration of life's ultimate questions. It is a call to embrace the absurd as a foundation for a richer understanding of human freedom and potential.

### Impressions
The overall writing style was very difficult to comprehend, I really loved the theme and subject of the book. 

### How I Discovered It
Read his other book ([The Stranger](https://for-future-me.vercel.app/posts/The-Stranger/)) so I decided to give another book of his a shot

### Who Should Read It?
may be a worthwhile read for anyone who is interested in exploring philosophical ideas and themes, and who is open to considering different perspectives on the human experience. It may also be of interest to readers who are interested in literature and cultural movements that explore themes of meaning and purpose.

### Actionable Takeaways
he fundamental subject of ‚ÄúThe Myth of Sisyphus‚Äù is this: it is legitimate and necessary to wonder whether life has a meaning; therefore it is legitimate to meet the problem of suicide face to face. The answer, underlying and appearing through the paradoxes which cover it, is this: even if one does not believe in God, suicide is not legitimate.

### Top Quotes
> If the only significant history of human thought were to be written, it would have to be the history of its successive regrets and its impotences.

> "A man is more a man through the things he keeps to himself than through those he says. There are many that I shall keep to myself."

> Seeking what is true is not seeking what is desirable.

> If the world were clear, art would not exist.

## Summary + Notes
---
### Preface
- The fundamental subject of ‚ÄúThe Myth of Sisyphus‚Äù is this: it is legitimate and necessary to wonder whether life has a meaning; therefore it is legitimate to meet the problem of suicide face to face. The answer, underlying and appearing through the paradoxes which cover it, is this: even if one does not believe in God, suicide is not legitimate.

- Written 15 years ago (**82 years now**), in 1940, amid the French and European disaster, this book declares that even within the limits of nihilism it is possible to find the means to proceed beyond nihilism.

### Absurdity and Suicide
- There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide. Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy. All the rest‚Äîwhether or not the world has three dimensions, whether the mind has nine or twelve categories‚Äîcomes afterwards.

- I see others paradoxically getting killed for the ideas or illusions that give them a reason for living (what is called a reason for living is also an excellent reason for dying).

### Absurd Walls
- If the only significant history of human thought were to be written, it would have to be the history of its successive regrets and its impotences.

- To the man lost in the world and its diversions this anxiety is a brief, fleeting fear. But if that fear becomes conscious of itself, it becomes anguish, the perpetual climate of the lucid man ‚Äúin whom existence is concentrated.‚Äù This professor of philosophy writes without trembling and in the most abstract language in the world that ‚Äúthe finite and limited character of human existence is more primordial than man himself.‚Äù His interest in Kant extends only to recognizing the restricted character of his ‚Äúpure Reason.‚Äù This is to coincide at the end of his analyses that ‚Äúthe world can no longer offer anything to the man filled with anguish.‚Äù

- This anxiety seems to him so much more important than all the categories in the world that he thinks and talks only of it. He enumerates its aspects: boredom when the ordinary man strives to quash it in him and benumb it; terror when the mind contemplates death. He too does not separate consciousness from the absurd. The consciousness of death is the call of anxiety and ‚Äúexistence then delivers itself its own summons through the intermediary of consciousness.‚Äù

- The man who writes: ‚ÄúThe surest of stubborn silences is not to hold one‚Äôs tongue but to talk‚Äù makes sure in the beginning that no truth is absolute or can render satisfactory an existence that is impossible in itself.

- Thinking is learning all over again to see, to be attentive, to focus consciousness; it is turning every idea and every image, in the manner of Proust, into a privileged moment. What justifies thought is its extreme consciousness.

- The mind, when it reaches its limits, must make a judgment and choose its conclusions. This is where suicide and the reply stand. But I wish to reverse the order of the inquiry and start out from the intelligent adventure and come back to daily acts.

- At this point of his effort man stands face to face with the irrational. He feels within him his longing for happiness and for reason. The absurd is born of this confrontation between the human need and the unreasonable silence of the world. This must not be forgotten. This must be clung to because the whole consequence of a life can depend on it. The irrational, the human nostalgia, and the absurd that is born of their encounter‚Äîthese are the three characters in the drama that must necessarily end with all the logic of which an existence is capable.

### Philosophical Suicide
- There exists an obvious fact that seems utterly moral: namely, that a man is always a prey to his truths. Once he has admitted them, he cannot free himself from them. One has to pay something. A man who has be-come conscious of the absurd is forever bound to it. A man devoid of hope and conscious of being so has ceased to belong to the future. That is natural. But it is just as natural that he should strive to escape the universe of which he is the creator.
	- A person is bound to their truths and must accept the consequences. When they recognize the inherent meaninglessness of the world, they lose hope for the future. However, they may still try to find meaning and escape their own creation.

- ‚ÄúThe only true solution,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúis precisely where human judgment sees no solution. Otherwise, what need would we have of God? We turn toward God only to obtain the impossible. As for the possible, men suffice.‚Äù

- If there is an absurd, it is in man‚Äôs universe. The moment the notion transforms itself into eternity‚Äôs springboard, it ceases to be linked to human lucidity. The absurd is no longer that evidence that man ascertains without consenting to it. The struggle is eluded.

- The important thing, as Abbe Galiani said to Mme d‚ÄôEpinay, is not to be cured, but to live with one‚Äôs ailments. Kierkegaard wants to be cured. To be cured is his frenzied wish, and it runs throughout his whole journal. The entire effort of his intelligence is to escape the antinomy of the human condition.

- Seeking what is true is not seeking what is desirable.

- In fact, our aim is to shed light upon the step taken by the mind when, starting from a philosophy of the world‚Äôs lack of meaning, it ends up by finding a meaning and depth in it. The most touching of those steps is religious in essence; it becomes obvious in the theme of the irrational. But the most paradoxical and most significant is certainly the one that attributes rational reasons to a world it originally imagined as devoid of any guiding principle.

- Thinking is not unifying or making the appearance familiar under the guise of a great principle. Thinking is learning all over again how to see, directing one‚Äôs consciousness, making of every image a privileged place. In other words, phenomenology declines to explain the world, it wants to be merely a description of actual experience. It confirms absurd thought in its initial assertion that there is no truth, but merely truths. From the evening breeze to this hand on my shoulder, everything has its truth. Consciousness illuminates it by paying attention to it. Consciousness does not form the object of its understanding, it merely focuses, it is the act of attention, and, to borrow a Bergsonian image, it resembles the projector that suddenly focuses on an image. The difference is that there is no scenario, but a successive and incoherent illustration.

### Absurd Freedom
- Now the main thing is done, I hold certain facts from which I cannot separate. What I know, what is certain, what I cannot deny, what I cannot reject‚Äîthis is what counts.

- Now I can broach the notion of suicide. It has already been felt what solution might be given. At this point the problem is reversed. It was previously a question of finding out whether or not life had to have a meaning to be lived. It now becomes clear, on the contrary, that it will be lived all the better if it has no meaning. Living an experience, a particular fate, is accepting it fully. Now, no one will live this fate, knowing it to be absurd, unless he does everything to keep before him that absurd brought to light by consciousness. Negating one of the terms of the opposition on which he lives amounts to escaping it.
	- Suicide may be a solution to the problem of living in a meaningless world. However, accepting and fully living one's fate, even if it is absurd, can lead to a better life. Keeping the absurdity of the world in mind can help a person live their life meaningfully, rather than trying to escape it.

- Suicide, like the leap, is acceptance at its extreme. Everything is over and man returns to his essential history. His future, his unique and dreadful future‚Äîhe sees and rushes toward it. In its way, suicide settles the absurd. It engulfs the absurd in the same death. But I know that in order to keep alive, the absurd cannot be settled. It escapes suicide to the extent that it is simultaneously awareness and rejection of death.

- The contrary of suicide, in fact, is the man condemned to death.
 That revolt gives life its value. Spread out over the whole length of a life, it restores its majesty to that life. To a man devoid of blinders, there is no finer sight than that of the intelligence at grips with a reality that transcends it. The sight of human pride is unequaled.

- The problem of ‚Äúfreedom as such‚Äù has no meaning, for it is linked in quite a different way with the problem of God. Knowing whether or not man is free involves knowing whether he can have a master. The absurdity peculiar to this problem comes from the fact that the very notion that makes the problem of freedom possible also takes away all its meaning. For in the presence of God there is less a problem of freedom than a problem of evil. You know the alternative: either we are not free and God the all-powerful is responsible for evil.

-  But what does life mean in such a universe? Nothing else for the moment but indifference to the future and a desire to use up everything that is given. Belief in the meaning of life always implies a scale of values, a choice, our preferences. Belief in the absurd, according to our definitions, teaches the contrary.

- If I convince myself that this life has no other aspect than that of the absurd, if I feel that its whole equilibrium depends on that perpetual opposition between my conscious revolt and the darkness in which it struggles, if I admit that my freedom has no meaning except in relation to its limited fate, then I must say that what counts is not the best living but the most living. It is not up to me to wonder if this is vulgar or revolting, elegant or deplorable. Once and for all, value judgments are discarded here in favor of factual judgments

- For on the one hand the absurd teaches that all experiences are unimportant, and on the other it urges toward the greatest quantity of experiences.

- Being aware of one‚Äôs life, one‚Äôs revolt, one‚Äôs freedom, and to the maximum, is living, and to the maximum.

### The Absurd Man
> If Stavrogin believes, he does not think he believes. If he does not believe, he does not think he does not believe.
> \- The Possessed

### Drama
For him, not to be known is not to act, and not acting is dying a hundred times with all the creatures he would have brought to life or resuscitated.

### Conquest
‚ÄúA man is more a man through the things he keeps to himself than through those he says. There are many that I shall keep to myself.

### Philosophy and Fiction
- For the absurd man it is not a matter of explaining and solving, but of experiencing and describing.

- The idea of an art detached from its creator is not only outmoded; it is false. In opposition to the artist, it is pointed out that no philosopher ever created several systems. But that is true in so far, indeed, as no artist ever expressed more than one thing under different aspects.

- an absurd work of art to be possible, thought in its most lucid form must be involved in it. But at the same time thought must not be apparent except as the regulating intelligence. This paradox can be explained according to the absurd.

- The work of art is born of the intelligence‚Äôs refusal to reason the concrete. It marks the triumph of the carnal. It is lucid thought that provokes it, but in that very act that thought repudiates itself.

- The absurd work requires an artist conscious of these limitations and an art in which the concrete signifies nothing more than itself. It cannot be the end, the meaning, and the consolation of a life. Creating or not creating changes nothing. The absurd creator does not prize his work. He could repudiate it. He does sometimes repudiate it.

- If the world were clear, art would not exist.

- Expression begins where thought ends. Those adolescents with empty eyesockets who people temples and museums‚Äîtheir philosophy has been expressed in gestures. For an absurd man it is more educative than all libraries.

- A man wants to earn money in order to be happy, and his whole effort and the best of a life are devoted to the earning of that money. Happiness is forgotten; the means are taken for the end.

### Kirilov
-  All of Dostoevsky‚Äôs heroes question themselves as to the meaning of life. In this they are modern: they do not fear ridicule. What distinguishes modern sensibility from classical sensibility is that the latter thrives on moral problems and the former on metaphysical problems.

- In Dostoevsky‚Äôs novels the question is propounded with such intensity that it can only invite extreme solutions. Existence is illusory or it is eternal. If Dostoevsky were satisfied with this inquiry, he would be a philosopher. But he illustrates the consequences that such intellectual pastimes may have in a man‚Äôs life, and in this regard he is an artist.

### Ephemeral Creation
- perhaps the great work of art has less importance in itself than in the ordeal it demands of a man and the opportunity it provides him of overcoming his phantoms and approaching a little closer to his naked reality.

- if I have made myself clearly understood. The thesis-novel, the work that proves, the most hateful of all, is the one that most often is inspired by a smug thought. You demonstrate the truth you feel sure of possessing. But those are ideas one launches, and ideas are the contrary of thought. Those creators are philosophers, ashamed of themselves. Those I am speaking of or whom I imagine are, on the contrary, lucid thinkers.

### The Myth of Sysiphus
One does not discover the absurd without being tempted to write a manual of happiness. ‚ÄúWhat! by such narrow ways‚Äî?‚Äù There is but one world, however. Happiness and the absurd are two sons of the same earth. They are inseparable. It would be a mistake to say that happiness necessarily springs from the absurd discovery. It happens as well that the feeling of the absurd springs from happiness.

### Appendix: Hope and the Absurd in the Work of Franz Kafka
- The whole art of Kafka consists in forcing the reader to reread. His endings, or his absence of endings, suggest explanations which, however, are not revealed in clear language but, before they seem justified, require that the story be reread from another point of view. Sometimes there is a double possibility of interpretation, whence appears the necessity for two readings. This is what the author wanted. But it would be wrong to try to interpret everything in Kafka in detail. A symbol is always in general and, however precise its translation, an artist can restore to it only its movement: there is no word-for-word rendering.

- Moreover, nothing is harder to understand than a symbolic work. A symbol always transcends the one who makes use of it and makes him say in reality more than he is aware of expressing.

- By an odd but obvious paradox, the more extraordinary the character‚Äôs adventures are, the more noticeable will be the naturalness of the story: it is in proportion to the divergence we feel between the strangeness of a man‚Äôs life and the simplicity with which that man accepts it. It seems that this naturalness is Kafka‚Äôs. And, precisely, one is well aware what [[The Trial]] means.

- In this fundamental ambiguity lies Kafka‚Äôs secret. These perpetual oscillations between the natural and the extraordinary, the individual and the universal, the tragic and the everyday, the absurd and the logical, are found throughout his work and give it both its resonance and its meaning. These are the paradoxes that must be enumerated, the contradictions that must be strengthened, in order to understand the absurd work.
