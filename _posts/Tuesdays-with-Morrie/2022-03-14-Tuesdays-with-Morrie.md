## Top Quotes
> Accept the past as past, without denying it or discarding it

> The culture we have does not make people feel good about themselves. And you have to be strong enough to say if the culture doesn't work, don't buy it

> People walk around with a meaningless life. They seem half-asleep, even when they're busy doing things they think are important. This is because they're chasing the wrong things

> Know you're going to die, and to be prepared for it at any time. That's better. That way you can actually be more involved in your life while you're living.

> As I'm sitting here dying, when you most need it, neither money nor power will give you the feeling you're looking for, no matter how much of them you have

> Invest in the human family. Invest in people. Build a little community of those you love and who love you

## Summary + Notes

### Start
- Accept what you are able to do and what you are not able to do

- Accept the past as past, without denying it or discarding it

- Learn to forgive yourself and to forgive others

- Don't assume that it's too late to get involved

- The culture we have does not make people feel good about themselves. And you have to be strong enough to say if the culture doesn't work, don't buy it

- People walk around with a meaningless life. They seem half-asleep, even when they're busy doing things they think are important. This is because they're chasing the wrong things

- A teacher affects eternity; he can never tell where his influence stops.

- Know you're going to die, and to be prepared for it at any time. That's better. That way you can actually be more involved in your life while you're living.

- Learn how to die, and you learn how to live.

- Detachment doesn't mean you don't let the experience penetrate you. On the contrary, you let it penetrate you fully. That's how you are able to leave it.

- If you're always battling against getting older, you're always going to be unhappy, because it will happen anyhow.

- As I'm sitting here dying, when you most need it, neither `money` nor `power` will give you the feeling you're looking for, no matter how much of them you have.

- Invest in the human family. Invest in people. Build a little community of those you love and who love you
