# For Future Me - Archive of everything I write 
Welcome to the repository for my blog! Here, you'll find all the code and files that make up my blog.

My blog is built using the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) static site generator, and it is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

## About the Blog
Hello!!!
If you don’t know me, I’m Adam (idk why you’re here but) welcome to my “blog” ??? idk what to call this place. I’ll be writing about everything I learn/read as time goes by, you can think of this place as an archive of whatever I learn.

This began as a project where I wanted to build a website that would record everything I write and allow me to later in the future (thus the name) review the topics I’ve researched and read about.

Again, if you love reading and have time to spare, this is the right place for you. Hope you learn something new here, if you want to suggest any changes or just give your thoughts on the website or a post do reach out to me on any of my socials.

## Installation Guide 
To run my blog locally on your own computer, you'll need to have Jekyll installed. You can find instructions for how to do this on the Jekyll website. Once Jekyll is installed, simply clone this repository and run jekyll serve from the root directory of the repository. This will start a local server where you can view my blog in your web browser.

## Contribution
If you want to make any changes to my blog, simply edit the relevant files and submit a pull request. I'll review your changes and merge them into the main branch if they are approved.

## Theme
Chirpy Jekyll Theme, the [theme's docs](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy#documentation).
